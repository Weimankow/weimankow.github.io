Task: Improve Usability, Increase Visitor Traffic and Engagement for local Tech Community

# Problem Statement

WeBuild aims to build up the local tech community of developers, makers, and designers by promoting relevant content and events on their site. It is a open sourced project that anyone can contribute to.  

However, they have a problem with organizing important content visibly, so that non-tech people can find them. 

## Personal Goals

I took up this side project with a few aims - to challenge myself to learn Github, to get familiar with contributing to an open sourced project (FOSS), to experiment with creating UX documentation for a FOSS project.

## Approach
