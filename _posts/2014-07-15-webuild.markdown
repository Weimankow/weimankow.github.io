## Problem Statement

Webuild has many features that encourage community building, but are hidden within the interface.

## Personal Goals

I took up this side project with a few aims - to challenge myself to learn Github, to get familiar with contributing to an open sourced project (FOSS), to experiment with creating UX documentation for a FOSS project.

## Approach
