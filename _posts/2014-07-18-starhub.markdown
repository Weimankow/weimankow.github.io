## Brief
My Starhub is an app that helps Starhub customers view their data usage, pay bills and manage their account on the go. However, it has gathered many bad reviews since launch, and its design is out-dated. 

## Challenges
**Primary**: How can we redesign the app so that Starhub users enjoy using it? 

**Secondary**: How can we give it a visual identity that is modern and reflects its brand? 

## Process

#### Understanding Business and Competitors

<div>
	<p>I studied Starhub's latest annual report to understand whether an app revamp will be relevant to their business goals. 
	</p>

#### User Research and Analysis

<div>

	<p>We started by defining the target group we are designing for: current My Starhub users from 21 to 60 years old. </p>

	<img src="/img/portfolio/starhub_interviews.png" style="max-width: 750px">

	<p>We then came up with a set of questions and interviewed 9 starhub users to understand some scenerios where they use the app.</p>

	<img src="/img/portfolio/starhub_affinity.png" style= "max-width: 750px">


	<p>We consolidated our findings by grouping their needs and pain points in an affinity map.</p>

	<img src="/img/portfolio/starhub_personas.png" style="max-width: 750px">


	<p>Based on the map, we came up with three personas who are likely to use the app, as well as the scenerios they tend to use them in.</p>


	<p><h5>Insights:</h5></p>

	<img src="/img/portfolio/starhub_personas.png">

	<p>Persona 1:</p>
	<p> Miley, 25, a millenial, frequently uses snapchat, instagram, and tumblr to keep up with her friend's lives on-the-go.
	<p>Key Pain Points:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Current Starhub app is slow and laggy</li>
	<li>Needs to know when she exceeds her data limit</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<img src="/img/portfolio/a.png">

	<p>Persona 2:</p>
	<p> Aaron, 37, a successful businessman, has multiple phone lines and is often busy. He needs to easily check bills for all accounts and pay bills quickly while travelling from place to place. 
	<p>Key Pain Points:</p>

	<li>Difficult to view and choose which Starhub account to pay for</li>
	<li>Forced to download PDF bill to view breakdown of bill</li>
	<li>Lacking information to set up GIRO</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<img src="/img/portfolio/a.png">
